# Interhactive

<h1>Inspiration : </h1>
	While booking an appointment in a doctor’s chamber we face an ample amount of problems. First we have to go to the chamber which may be far away from our house and book an appointment in doctor’s chamber(weather may be a issue here).Secondly, the time the paitent has may not match with that of the available time of the doctor. Thirdly, a lot of time may be consumed in this process.
What problem does the project solve?
	The project solves the problem of time management by filling the gap between the paitent and the doctor by replacing human interaction by technology. As it is well known that time is a very precious element for anyone, This project helps in managing time in an efficient way.Also, in case of an emergency,Booking an appointment can be made easy using this project.
